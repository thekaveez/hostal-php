									<h5><b>Agreement Between the tenant and landlord in house renting system</b></h5>
<p>Absolutely! While drafting a rental agreement for a house, some considerations should be made.</br>
 The term of the lease, the amount due each month, the terms of the agreement,</br>
 the responsibilities of the landlord and tenant,and any additional special instructions are among them.</br>
 The tenant's right to privacy and the protection of their personal property should both be covered by the rental agreement.</br>
 It should also contain details on the site's usage policies, such as any occupancy limitations and the kinds of activities that are permitted there.</br>
Once all relevant information has been gathered, it should be put together into a legally binding agreement that is fair to both the landlord and the tenant.</p>
<h5><b>what is the responsibility of the landlord?</b></h5>
<p>In general, the Landlord shall provide the Tenant with a safe and habitable dwelling, shall comply with all applicable laws,</br>
 and shall take all reasonable steps to protect the Tenant from damage. </br>
In addition, the landlord is liable for any maintenance or repairs required to keep the rental property habitable. </br>
Additionally, the landlord is in charge of giving access to all amenities, including parking, </br>
common areas, garbage and recycling bins, and laundry facilities.</br>
 Additionally, the landlord is obligated to keep the property up to code with regard to environmental, health, and safety issues.</p>
